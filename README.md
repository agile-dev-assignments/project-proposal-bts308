VIRTUAL SYNTHESIZER

The purpose of this program is very simple: provide an onboard, virtual synthesizer. Ideally, a selection of waveforms (sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth) will be available for one or more
oscillators. Then, users will be able to adjust the envelope of the synthesizer, thus changing the
attack, release, sustain, decay, and hold. This will directly affect, in real time, the sound of the synth. The user should be able to play the synth with their QWERTY keyboard and/or mouse, and provided there is enough time, potentially Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) integration. 

The ideal user will be an experienced musician who wishes to have access to a cheap but reliable virtual synthesizer, but the interface should be simple enough for non-musicians to understand and use. The ability to use a free, simple synthesizer has many applications--compositional value for experienced electronic musicians, entertainment for non-musicians, and even educational value in demonstrating how audio signal is processed and changed through filtering, envelopes, and various forms of synthesis (frequency modulation, additive, subtractive, etc.).

Creating a virtual synthesizer is a perfect project for this class, as it not only strengthens understanding of basic music technology (a rapidly growing field that my classmates may not have been exposed to), but it also offers enough challenge within the implementation of the different aspects without being overwhelming for a small team. Thank you for your consideration!
